## 🔍 Why I Chose Data Analytics

My journey into tech was not linear.

### What I Tried First
- **Python**  
  I started with Python because it is beginner-friendly and widely used. While I learned the basics, I struggled to understand how to apply it to real-world business problems, which affected my motivation.

- **Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)**  
  I then explored web development and enjoyed seeing visual results quickly. I built basic portfolio and e-commerce websites, but at the intermediate JavaScript level, I realized I could follow tutorials without fully understanding how to implement concepts independently.

This helped me realize that I needed a field focused more on **analysis, problem-solving, and decision-making**, not just writing code.

- 🎓 **Civil Engineering** → analytical thinking & problem solving  
- 🎓 **MSc in Engineering Management** → business & decision-making  
- 🏥 **Healthcare experience** → domain knowledge & real-world context  

Data analytics allows me to combine **technical skills with business and healthcare insights**, creating meaningful and practical solutions.

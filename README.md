# My-Data-Analyst-Journey <br>
Hello friends, my name is Dilip Thakali. I am from Nepal, and I am currently living in the UK. I initially came to the UK as a student, and after completing my MSc in Engineering Management, I began working in the healthcare sector as a health carer. <br>
For some time, I have been considering a career switch to the tech field, but since I do not have a background in programming, I was unsure where to start. After doing extensive research, I discovered that Python is one of the easiest and most popular programming languages. Excited by this, I started learning Python. However, after completing a basic Python course, I felt bored and unmotivated because I had no clear understanding of where or how to apply the language in real-world scenarios. <br>
Seeking a more visually engaging learning experience, I shifted my focus to web development. I enjoyed seeing tangible progress while building websites, which kept me motivated. Over time, I successfully built e-commerce and portfolio websites using HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript. However, when I moved to intermediate-level JavaScript, I found it extremely difficult to grasp the concepts. Watching tutorials gave me the illusion of understanding, but when I attempted to apply the concepts independently, I struggled to implement them. <br>
Due to this challenge, I decided to pause my web development journey and explore data analytics as an alternative career path. Through additional research and with the help of ChatGPT, I realized that a data analyst role aligns well with my background. Since I hold a civil engineering degree and have completed an MSc in Engineering Management, I believe that acquiring the necessary data analytics skills will give me a strong chance of securing a job in the field. <br>
This time, I am approaching my learning journey differently. To track my progress and reinforce my understanding, I have decided to document everything through blogs and vlogs, sharing my journey from absolute beginner to job-ready data analyst. I have also developed a six-month roadmap for my learning. Although my plan does not specifically include learning soft skills such as resume building and optimizing my LinkedIn profile, I will be working on those alongside my technical studies. I will use only free resources to learn about this course and I will give a minimum of 2 hours a day. I will provide you with all the resources I have used and documents I have created. <br>
By documenting my learning process, I hope to create a valuable resource for others who are also transitioning into the data analytics field or exploring a career in tech. I believe that sharing my struggles, progress, and insights will help and inspire others facing similar challenges.<br>
